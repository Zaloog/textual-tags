This library provides a custom tags widget called `Tags`,
which can be easily added into your existing [textual] application.

Requires a Nerdfont to render the round corners of a Tag label.
## Features
- Can be initiated with a predefined set/list of tags, similar entries will be ignored
- Consists of a TagInput, with autocompletion powered by [textual-autocomplete] for existing tags
and displayed tags wrapped in a flexbox-like container
- Two different ways to display the tags (with `x` at the end or without)
- Option to also add new not predefined tags, which are then also available for autocompletion
- vim-like completion control
